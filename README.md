# Genetic Programming
Define the problem and expected outputs, and a solution will be evolved to
solved the defined problem.


## Quickstart
Call `make setup` to set up the virtualenvironment and then `make debug` to
watch it start churning away at an example problem.


## Project Info
* `requirements.txt` containts the requirements
* tests in `./tests`, can be run using `make test`
* to run the program call `make run` or `make debug`
* documentation in `./docs`, can be updated using `make docs`


## Useful Tools
`python -m cProfile -s tottime gp/__main__.py` profile, sorted by total time in each function.
